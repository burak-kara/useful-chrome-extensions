# 🛒 Decathlon Product Links in New Tab

When browsing products on Decathlon websites, clicking a product **doesn't open it in a new tab** — this forces users to hit the browser's back button repeatedly if they want to compare multiple products. It slows down the experience and gets frustrating with deep navigation.

This Chrome extension automatically modifies all product links on Decathlon pages to **open in a new tab**, allowing you to explore multiple items more efficiently.
